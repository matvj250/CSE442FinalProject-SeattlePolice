# What Has Caused Seattle Police Response Times to Change over Time?

This was my final project for CSE442, my UW Paul Allen School data visualization class. These files are all for the final deliverable of this project, an "explorable explanation". Ours is structured like a news article, but there's more emphasis on the visualizations (e.g. telling readers to play around with them). The actual website code wasn't written by me, instead by one of my group members for the final project. However, along with leading the project, doing all the wrangling (shown in a separate repository on this page), and working on some of the visualizations, I wrote and revised the great majority of the text accompanying the visualizations.
